# Welcome
my python project ryzen is an ai model ehich uses voice commands to take the input as well as the output is also in audio form<br />
:\ however it can perform some basic tasks such as<br />
_ open youtube<br />
_ open google<br />
_ search in wikipedia<br />
:\ it can also play music but for that you will have to initialize the path or the location of the folder soon we will be including spotify in our program;<br />
   till now version 1.0.0 of ryzen is devloped and tested<br />
